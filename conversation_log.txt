Conversation log - Spam analysis project
Date: 2025-10-23

Summary:
- Filled out openspec/project.md with project purpose, tech stack, conventions.
- Created OpenSpec change proposal: changes/add-rich-preprocessing-and-streamlit-views (proposal.md, tasks.md, specs/spam-analysis/spec.md).
- Implemented minimal pipeline: data/load_data.py, features/vectorize.py, viz/plot.py, models/train.py, app/streamlit_app.py, scripts/run_pipeline.py.
- Added requirements.txt, README.md, tests/test_data.py and package __init__.py files for imports.
- Created and activated virtualenv (.venv) and installed dependencies; ran pytest (1 passed).
- Fixed import path issues for Streamlit and runner by inserting project root into sys.path in app/streamlit_app.py and scripts/run_pipeline.py.
- Launched Streamlit server and confirmed it's reachable at http://localhost:8501.
- Simulated Streamlit "Run preprocessing & train baseline" using scripts/run_pipeline.py which produced artifacts: features/vectorizer.pkl, models/baseline.joblib, viz/out/* and showed metrics.
- Enhanced Streamlit app to show Confusion Matrix and ROC curve after training.

Notes / Next steps:
- Consider consolidating artifact paths under artifacts/ or outputs/.
- Add more tests around preprocessing and vectorizer behavior.
- Optionally create a PR with the changes and add CI to run pytest and openspec validation.

2025-10-22 Conversation

Note: The full raw transcript for 2025-10-22 was not provided in this workspace. If you want the exact conversation text added here, please paste it or upload the transcript file and I will replace this placeholder with the verbatim content.

Summary placeholder for 2025-10-22:
- Brief interactions and planning prior to work on 10/23. (No verbatim transcript available.)

Recent updates (2025-10-23): UI & prediction improvements
- Added Predict single message UI to Streamlit and implemented artifact loading (vectorizer + model) for live predictions.
- Added example templates dropdown to prefill the input area for quick testing.
- Implemented colorized prediction card: red for SPAM, green for NOT SPAM.
- Added a 0-100% progress bar to display spam probability visually.

Recent debug & modelling updates (2025-10-23): recall-model improvements
- Encountered a Streamlit ImportError / TypeError while loading updated training code: `train_recall_focused_model` signature mismatch (old process lacked `target_accuracy` argument).
- Fixed `models/train.py` to expand hyperparameter search and add `target_accuracy` parameter and success flag; added diagnostic prints for candidate metrics.
- Updated `scripts/run_pipeline.py` and `app/streamlit_app.py` to call the new signature and pass baseline metrics when training recall-only from the UI.
- Restarted Streamlit and validated new behavior. Ran the pipeline: several candidates evaluated; found candidates that satisfy recall > baseline and accuracy >= 0.9. The chosen recall-model example metrics (validation): accuracy 0.9843, precision 0.9483, recall 0.9322, f1 0.9402 (threshold 0.37). Model saved as `models/recall_model.joblib` and vectorizer as `features/vectorizer_recall.pkl`.

2025-10-23 Training run: recall-model re-training
-----------------------------------------------
- Command: python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py
- Dataset: sms_spam_no_header.csv (5574 rows)
- Baseline (test) metrics:
  - accuracy: 0.9713004484304932
  - precision: 0.9849624060150376
  - recall: 0.8136645962732919
  - f1: 0.891156462585034
- Recall-focused training summary:
  - Multiple candidate classifiers evaluated (LogisticRegression, RandomForest) with several class_weight and hyperparameter settings.
  - Several candidates met the acceptance criteria (Accuracy>=0.90, Precision>=0.90, Recall>=0.82). Example satisfying candidates printed during training included:
    - LogisticRegression (C=1.0, class_weight=None) | threshold=0.29 | accuracy=0.9753363 | precision=0.9363636 | recall=0.87288136
    - LogisticRegression (C=10.0, class_weight=None) | threshold=0.26 | accuracy=0.98318386 | precision=0.94017094 | recall=0.93220339
    - RandomForest variants (balanced/class_weight scaling) also produced several satisfying candidates.
  - Final selected recall-model (validation metrics):
    - accuracy: 0.984304932735426
    - precision: 0.9482758620689655
    - recall: 0.9322033898305084
    - f1: 0.94017094017094
    - selected decision threshold: 0.37
    - success: True
- Artifacts saved:
  - features/vectorizer.pkl (baseline vectorizer)
  - features/vectorizer_recall.pkl (recall vectorizer)
  - models/baseline.joblib
  - models/recall_model.joblib
  - viz/out/confusion.png

Notes:
- The recall-model meets the requested acceptance thresholds (Accuracy>=90%, Precision>=90%, Recall>=82%).
- If you want metadata persisted with the model (params + selected threshold + validation metrics), I can save a small JSON next to /Users/bradpan/Desktop/物聯網數據分析與應用/hw3/models/recall_model.joblib (e.g. models/recall_model.metadata.json).
